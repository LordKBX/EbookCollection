  <h1>Ch01 - I Don’t Want to Work…!</h1>
  <div class="block">“I don’t want to work.”</div>
  <div class="block">I was being summoned into another world. Well, when I, Masuda Keima, was asked for my only condition by God, that’s how I responded.</div>
  <div class="block">“… Umm, what did you want?”<br/>
“A life that I wouldn’t need to do anything would be good…”<br/>
“… Even if you’re reincarnated as a tree or something?”<br/>
“Oh, that’d be great~”</div>
  <div class="block">God sighed with an amazed expression.</div>
  <div class="block">“You know… were you listening to what I said when I asked for your condition?”<br/>
“Eh? What was it again?”</div>
  <div class="block">I think he was talking about the mana circulation and something about monsters, but I wasn’t really listening.</div>
  <div class="block">“In your original world, could you have researched something like a golem? Doesn’t that fill you with motivation…?”<br/>
“Eh? Hahaha, not really. Students nowadays might be like that though.”</div>
  <div class="block">Being able to make a maid robot that I could leave everything to and live in comfort is my dream.<br/>
This God already figured out I’m a failure after I only spoke a few words, wonder what he’d say to me if I told him about my dream?<br/>
By the way, I actually did mess around with looking into thirty centimeter ready-made robot kit that could move at school. Make it myself? Too troublesome…</div>
  <div class="block">“Yep, time’s up… it was a special chance, but I’ll try asking the next person.”<br/>
“Heeeh…”<br/>
“Well, I’ll just make you able to understand languages. Also, if you work hard I’ll give you a proportional blessing.”<br/>
“I don’t want to work…”<br/>
“There is magic in the world you’ll be reincarnating into, but I don’t believe civilization has developed to the point where you won’t have to work. Besides, you being summoned probably means someone wants you to do something.”<br/>
“I want to go home…”<br/>
“Well, do your best yeah?”</div>
  <div class="block">My vision was enveloped in a bright light.<br/>
Like that, I was summoned into another world.</div>
  <p class="elypsys">♦ ♦ ♦</p>
  <div class="block">“A-alright! The summon was successful! … Eh, wait, a-a human!? Why!?”</div>
  <div class="block">I don’t know what sort of principle was behind it, but I appeared in a room whose walls were shining a pale white.<br/>
Before my eyes was a loli wearing a white dress. A cute-type little girl that lolicons would covet.<br/>
I prefer them grown up more though unfortunately, sorry.<br/>
… As a foot fetishist, they’d have to have on knee socks though.</div>
  <div class="block">“Why… why’d such a weakling come out even though I put in all of my DP…”<br/>
“… Can I sleep?”<br/>
“Eh—”<br/>
“Can I go to sleep? Oh, is there a futon?”<br/>
“I-it taaaaaaaalked!?”</div>
  <div class="block">The heck. She’s still yapping even though I said I was sleepy.</div>
  <div class="block">“Ugugu, what, I didn’t hear anything about a gacha monster talking! … Oh right, it’s a human huh? Maybe that’s why it’s talking?”<br/>
  “Oi, whoever you are… you’re giving me a headache, keep your voice down.”<br/>
“Oh, u-un… Wait, what’s with you!? I’m the summoner, you should be listening to what I say!”<br/>
“Oi, little girl… where’s your papa and mama? I’d like to go home.”<br/>
“Who’s a little girl! F-fine, you’re a monster summoned by a Dungeon Core! I’m going to work you until you die!”</div>
  <div class="block">Dungeon Core… monster… yup, I don’t get it. I was summoned, so am I a hero or something?</div>
  <div class="block">“Hey, hurry up and head out to slaughter those bandits! I sunk a full 1000 DP into you so you’re actually pretty strong right!?”</div>
  <img alt="Image" src="../images/ch01-1.jpg"/>
  <div class="block">She just started talking about something dangerous, oi.</div>
  <div class="block">“Right, I’ll listen to you for a bit, so speak. What’s a Dungeon Core, what are monsters, and what’s this dee pee thing? As for being summoned… I get that part.”<br/>
“Oh, what, maybe it’s smart since it can talk? Maybe it’s a mage-type… well, it’s fine. This is my dungeon.”<br/>
“A little girl Dungeon Master…?”<br/>
“Hmm, you know about Dungeon Masters. But there isn’t a Dungeon Master in my dungeon. Ah, if I had to say, I guess I’m the Dungeon Master?”</div>
  <div class="block">I obviously don’t know this world’s Dungeon Masters are, but I imagine they’re something like the ones in fantasy games.
But, Dungeon Core… in other words, it’s the heart of the dungeon. This little girl is…?</div>
  <div class="block">“Rather, you said humans are weaklings, but aren’t you a human?”<br/>
“I’m not, it’s just that my appearance is a human’s… wait, what’s with that ‘you’!? Call me master!”<br/>
“Ah, come to think of it, I haven’t asked your name huh. What is it?”<br/>
“Mine? It’s Dungeon Core No. 695.”</div>
  <div class="block">A number? Talk about cutting corners… well, if there’s a No. 695 I guess that means there’s at least 694 others. If that’s it, naming would be one of those things that gets skimped on.</div>
  <div class="block">“Got it, Rokuko.”<br/>
“Huh? What?”<br/>
“Well, it’s hard to say Dungeon Core No. such and such, so I decided that your name is Rokuko. Your full name is Dungeon Core Rokuko. Ah, I’m Masuda Keima.”</div>
  <div class="block">Rokuko, formerly named Dungeon Core No. 695, looked at me and started to saying something.</div>
  <div class="block">“Huh? Mahsewtah Kehma? … Is that a nickname? Rather, what are you going and deciding on your own–”</div>
  <div class="block">[Naming received, a Master has been acknowledged.]</div>
  <div class="block">““Eh?””</div>
  <div class="block">I don’t understand what’s going on, but that’s how I became a Dungeon Master.</div>
